# BoostDILI: Extreme Gradient Boost Powered Drug Induced Liver Injury Prediction using Feature Level Representation

## Overview
In this study, we developed an XGBoost powered machine learning model for DILI prediction. Comparing various DILI prediction models is challenging because of their reliance on different public datasets. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed BoostDILI model to address two crucial questions: 1. Can insights derived from public datasets help in DILI prediction for FDA-approved drugs? 2. Can we elucidate the reasoning behind the models and the descriptors utilized in their development? To address the first question, we developed a DILI prediction model using four publicly available datasets (NCTR, Greene et. al., Xu et. al., and Liew et. al.,). This effort led to the creation of the BoostDILI model, which achieved a high MCC of 0.99.
